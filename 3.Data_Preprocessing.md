**4. Explain data normalization ?**
->The goal of normalization is to make an entire set of values have a particular property.
Methods used for data normalization:
  1)Min-Max Normalization:
Transform the data from measured units to a new
interval from 𝑛𝑒𝑤_𝑚𝑖𝑛𝐹 to 𝑛𝑒𝑤_𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐹 for feature 𝐹:
𝑣′=[(𝑣 − 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝐹)/(𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐹 − 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝐹)]*(𝑛𝑒𝑤_𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐹 − 𝑛𝑒𝑤_𝑚𝑖𝑛𝐹) + 𝑛𝑒𝑤_𝑚𝑖𝑛𝐹
where 𝑣 is the current value of feature 𝐹.
Suppose that the minimum and maximum values for
the feature income are $120,000 and $98,000,
respectively. We would like to map income to the range
0.0,1.0 . By min-max normalization, a value of $73,600
for income is transformed to:
(73,600 − 12,000)/(98,000 − 12,000)*(1.0 − 0.0 )+ 0 = 0.716
2)z-score (zero-mean) Normalization Transform the data by converting the values to a common scale with an average of zero and a standard deviation of one. A value, 𝑣, of 𝐴 is normalized to 𝑣 ′ by computing: 𝑣 ′ = (𝑣 − 𝐹 )/𝜎𝐹 where 𝐹 and 𝜎𝐹 are the mean and standard deviation of feature 𝐹, respectively.
Suppose that the mean and standard deviation of the values for the feature income are $54,000 and $16,000, respectively. With z-score normalization, a value of $73,6000 for income is transformed to (73,600 − 54,000)/ 16,000 = 1.225
3) Decimal Scaling Normalization Transform the data by moving the decimal points of values of feature 𝐹. The number of decimal points moved depends on the maximum absolute value of 𝐹. A value 𝑣 of 𝐹 is normalized to 𝑣 ′ by computing : 𝑣 ′ = 𝑣 /10𝑗 , where 𝑗 is the smallest integer such that 𝑀𝑎𝑥(| 𝑣 ′|) < 1
Suppose that the recorded values of 𝐹 range from − 986 to 917. The maximum absolute value of 𝐹 is 986. To normalize by decimal scaling, we therefore divide each value by 1,000 (i.e., 𝑗 = 3) so that −986 normalizes to −0.986 and 917 normalizes to 0.917.
