** 1. What is an outlier ? Describe methods that can be used for outlier analysis.**

An outlier is an observation point that is distant from other observations.

There are 3 types of outliers:
1.Global outlier
2.Contextual outlier.
3.Collective outlier.

Methods used for outlier analysis:

1.Supervised Methods:
. Model data normality and abnormality. 
. Domain experts examine and label a sample of the underlying data. 
. Outlier detection can then be modeled as a classification problem. 
. The task is to learn a classifier that can recognize outliers. The sample is used for training and testing.

Challenges to supervised outlier detection: 
• The two classes (i.e., normal objects versus outliers) are imbalanced. 
• That is, the population of outliers is typically much smaller than that of normal objects. 
• Therefore, methods for handling imbalanced classes may be used, such as oversampling (i.e., replicating) outliers to increase their distribution in the training set used to construct the classifier.

2.Unsupervised methods:

An unsupervised outlier detection method expects that normal objects follow a pattern far more frequently than outliers. 
Normal objects do not have to fall into one group sharing high similarity. Instead, they can form multiple groups, where each group has distinct features.

3.Semi-supervised method:

• We may encounter cases where only a small set of the normal and/or outlier objects are labeled, but most of the data are unlabeled. 
• Semi-supervised outlier detection methods were developed to tackle such scenarios.If only some labeled outliers are available, semi-supervised outlier detection is trickier. A small number of labeled outliers are unlikely to represent all the possible outliers.

4.Proximity-based methods:

Assumption: 
An object is an outlier if the nearest neighbour of the object are far away in feature space, that is, the proximity/distance of the object to its neighbors significantly deviates from the proximity of most of 
the other objects to their neighbors in the same data set.

• The effectiveness of proximity-based methods relies heavily on the proximity (or distance) measure used.
• Moreover, proximity-based methods often have difficulty in detecting a group of outliers if the outliers are close to one another. 
• There are two major types of proximity-based outlier detection, namely distance-based and density-based outlier detection.

5.Clustering-based methods:

Clustering-based methods assume that the normal data objects belong to large and dense clusters, whereas outliers belong to small or sparse clusters, or do not belong to any clusters.
