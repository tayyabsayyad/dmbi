These are few questions which we normally ask in DBMI.

What is data mining ?

Data Mining is a computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics and database system.
Or it can be defined as 
Data mining is a process of discovering interesting patterns from huge amounts of data.


Is data mining a hype ?

What is Machine Learning ?
It is subfield of comuter science that focuses on getting computer to act without being explicitly programmed.It focuses on the development of computer program that can change when exposed to new data.

What is data preprocessing ?

Why we need to to preprocess the data ?

What is consequence of having a data outliers ?
An outliers is a value that is very different from the other data in your data set.This can skew your results.

What is outlier ?
An outliers is a data object in a data set that deviates significantly from the rest of the data object, as if it were generated by a different mechanism

What are different methods of detecting outliers ?

Are their any applications detecting of outliers ?

What is data exploration ?
Data exploration is the first step in data analysis and typically involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset. It is commonly conducted using visual analytics tools, but can also be done in more advanced statistical software, such as R.

Explain data preprocessing steps ?
. Data Cleaning: Clean the data by filling in missing values, smoothening noisy data, identifying and
removing outliers and inconsistencies.
b. Data Integration: Data analysis involves integrating multiple databases, data cubes or files to
obtain consolidated data. Before any data is used, integration problems such as naming
inconsistencies, data type conflicts, redundancy and so on must be resolved.
c. Data Reduction: Obtains a reduced representation of the dataset that is much smaller in volume,
and yet produces same analytical results.
d. Data Transformation: Data is transformed or consolidated into formats appropriate for mining.


What are the main tasks of data mining ?
. Characterization
b. Discrimination
c. Association and Correlation Analysis
d. Classification
e. Prediction
f. Clustering
g. Outlier Analysis
h. Evolution Analysis

What is classification ?

What is clustering ?
Clustering analyzes data objects without consulting a known class label. The objects are clustered
or grouped based on the principle of maximizing the intraclass similarity and minimizing the interclass
similarity. Each cluster that is formed can be viewed as a class of objects. Clustering can also facilitate
taxonomy formation, that is, the organization of observations into a hierarchy of classes that group
similar events together.
