**1. Define “Data mining”. Enumerate five example application that can benifit by using the Data Mining.**<br>
Data mining is the computing process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. The following are certain applcations of data mining.
  * Health Care<br>
  We can use data and analytics to identify best practices that improve care and reduce costs. Researchers use data mining approaches to predict the volume of patients in every category or can be used to find trends or predicting epidemics etc. Processes are developed that make sure that the patients receive appropriate care at the right place and at the right time. Data mining can also help healthcare insurers to detect fraud and abuse.
  * Market Basket Analysis<br>
  Market basket analysis is a modelling technique based upon a theory that if you buy a certain group of items you are more likely to buy another group of items. This technique may allow the retailer to understand the purchase behaviour of a buyer. This information may help the retailer to know the buyer’s needs and change the store’s layout accordingly. Using differential analysis comparison of results between different stores, between customers in different demographic groups can be done.
   * Fraud Detection<br>
  Traditional methods of fraud detection are time consuming and complex. Data mining aids in providing meaningful patterns and turning data into information. Any information that is valid and useful is knowledge. A perfect fraud detection system should protect information of all the users. A supervised method includes collection of sample records. These records are classified fraudulent or non-fraudulent. A model is built using this data and the algorithm is made to identify whether the record is fraudulent or not.
  * Customer Segmentation<br>
  Traditional market research may help us to segment customers but data mining goes in deep and increases market effectiveness. Data mining aids in aligning the customers into a distinct segment and can tailor the needs according to the customers. Market is always about retaining the customers. Data mining allows to find a segment of customers based on vulnerability and the business could offer them with special offers and enhance satisfaction.
  * Bio Informatics<br>
  Data Mining approaches seem ideally suited for Bioinformatics, since it is data-rich. Mining biological data helps to extract useful knowledge from massive datasets gathered in biology, and in other related life sciences areas such as medicine and neuroscience. Applications of data mining to bioinformatics include gene finding, protein function inference, disease diagnosis, disease prognosis, disease treatment optimization, protein and gene interaction network reconstruction, data cleansing, and protein sub-cellular location prediction.

**2. Explain Data Mining as a step of KDD ( Knowledge Discovery ). Give architecture of typical Dataming System.**<br>
The term Knowledge Discovery in Databases, or KDD for short, refers to the broad process of finding knowledge in data, and emphasizes the "high-level" application of particular data mining methods. It is of interest to researchers in machine learning, pattern recognition, databases, statistics, artificial intelligence, knowledge acquisition for expert systems, and data visualization.
The unifying goal of the KDD process is to extract knowledge from data in the context of large databases.
It does this by using data mining methods (algorithms) to extract (identify) what is deemed knowledge, according to the specifications of measures and thresholds, using a database along with any required preprocessing, subsampling, and transformations of that database.

The overall process of finding and interpreting patterns from data involves the repeated application of the following steps:

1. Developing an understanding of
  * the application domain
  * the relevant prior knowledge
  * the goals of the end-user
2. Creating a target data set: selecting a data set, or focusing on a subset of variables, or data samples, on which discovery is to be performed.
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  * Removal of noise or outliers.
  * Collecting necessary information to model or account for noise.
  * Strategies for handling missing data fields.
  * Accounting for time sequence information and known changes.
4. Data reduction and projection.
  * Finding useful features to represent the data depending on the goal of the task.
  * Using dimensionality reduction or transformation methods to reduce the effective number of variables under consideration or to find invariant representations for the data.
5. Choosing the data mining task.
  * Deciding whether the goal of the KDD process is classification, regression, clustering, etc.
6. Choosing the data mining algorithm(s).
  * Selecting method(s) to be used for searching for patterns in the data.
  * Deciding which models and parameters may be appropriate.
  * Matching a particular data mining method with the overall criteria of the KDD process.
7. Data mining.
  * Searching for patterns of interest in a particular representational form or a set of such representations as classification rules or trees, regression, clustering, and so forth.
8. Interpreting mined patterns.

**2. Explain Data Mining as a step of KDD ( Knowledge Discovery ). Give architecture of typical Dataming System.**

Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is the process of discovering useful knowledge from a collection of data. This widely used data mining technique is a process that includes data preparation and selection, data cleansing, incorporating prior knowledge on data sets and interpreting accurate solutions from the observed results. 

Major KDD application areas include marketing, fraud detection, telecommunication and manufacturing.

Here is the list of steps involved in the knowledge discovery process −
•	Data Cleaning − In this step, the noise and inconsistent data is removed.
•	Data Integration − In this step, multiple data sources are combined.
•	Data Selection − In this step, data relevant to the analysis task are retrieved from the database.
•	Data Transformation − In this step, data is transformed or consolidated into forms appropriate for mining by performing summary or aggregation operations.
•	Data Mining − In this step, intelligent methods are applied in order to extract data patterns.
•	Pattern Evaluation − In this step, data patterns are evaluated.
•	Knowledge Presentation − In this step, knowledge is represented.

In KDD process,
In Data mining intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns from data.


Data Mining Architecture:
The major components of any data mining system are data source, data warehouse server, data mining engine, pattern evaluation module, graphical user interface and knowledge base.
 

a) Data Sources
Database, data warehouse, World Wide Web (WWW), text files and other documents are the actual sources of data. You need large volumes of historical data for data mining to be successful. Organizations usually store data in databases or data warehouses. Data warehouses may contain one or more databases, text files, spreadsheets or other kinds of information repositories. Sometimes, data may reside even in plain text files or spreadsheets. World Wide Web or the Internet is another big source of data.

Different Processes
The data needs to be cleaned, integrated and selected before passing it to the database or data warehouse server. As the data is from different sources and in different formats, it cannot be used directly for the data mining process because the data might not be complete and reliable. So, first data needs to be cleaned and integrated. Again, more data than required will be collected from different data sources and only the data of interest needs to be selected and passed to the server. These processes are not as simple as we think. A number of techniques may be performed on the data as part of cleaning, integration and selection.

b) Database or Data Warehouse Server
The database or data warehouse server contains the actual data that is ready to be processed. Hence, the server is responsible for retrieving the relevant data based on the data mining request of the user.

c) Data Mining Engine
The data mining engine is the core component of any data mining system. It consists of a number of modules for performing data mining tasks including association, classification, characterization, clustering, prediction, time-series analysis etc.

d) Pattern Evaluation Modules
The pattern evaluation module is mainly responsible for the measure of interestingness of the pattern by using a threshold value. It interacts with the data mining engine to focus the search towards interesting patterns.

e) Graphical User Interface
The graphical user interface module communicates between the user and the data mining system. This module helps the user use the system easily and efficiently without knowing the real complexity behind the process. When the user specifies a query or a task, this module interacts with the data mining system and displays the result in an easily understandable manner.

f) Knowledge Base
The knowledge base is helpful in the whole data mining process. It might be useful for guiding the search or evaluating the interestingness of the result patterns. The knowledge base might even contain user beliefs and data from user experiences that can be useful in the process of data mining. The data mining engine might get inputs from the knowledge base to make the result more accurate and reliable. The pattern evaluation module interacts with the knowledge base on a regular basis to get inputs and also to update it.

3 . IS Data Mining a hype? Explain ..
Ans : No, it is not a hype. It is the consequence of emergence of huge amounts of data and thedire need for turning such data into knowledge. Rapid growth and advancements in IT sector and computer science led to the coining of a process called Data miningIf you're a Facebook user, just look to the right and notice that all the advertisements seem to be things you've either recently looked at while shopping on various sites. Or maybe your political preferences are reflected.
