![Table 4.1](https://github.com/tayyabsayyad/dmbi/blob/master/Images/Table_4.1.png4)

2. Brifly explain Bagging and Boosting of the Classfiers


3. Define Classification, Issues of Classification and Explain ID3 classfication with example.


4. Explain different methods that can be used to evaluate and compare accuracy of different classfication algorthms.


5. Use any classification techniques and find out the class of (Homeowner = Yes, Status = Employed , Income = Average)

ID,Homeowner,Status,Income, Defaulted
1,Yes,Employed,High,No,
2,No,Business,Average,NO
3,No,Employed,Low,No

5,No,Unemployed,Average,Yes
6,No,Business,Low,No
7,Yes,Unemployed,High,No
8,No,Employed,Average,Yes
